1.Installation

	Download and Install below setup files
	JRE according to your OS and CPU architecture from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
	ZooKeeper http://zookeeper.apache.org/releases.html
	Kafka using http://kafka.apache.org/downloads.html

Running a Kafka Server
Important: Please ensure that your ZooKeeper instance is up and running before starting a Kafka server.

	1. Go to Kafka installation directory: C:\kafka_2.12-2.8.0\

	2. Open a command prompt here by pressing Shift + right click and choose the “Open command window here” option).

	3. Now type .\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties and press Enter.
	
	
Creating Topics
	1. Now create a topic with the name topic-vehicle-data and a replication factor of 1, as we have only one Kafka server running. If you have a cluster with more than one Kafka server running, you can increase the replication-factor accordingly, which will increase the data availability and act like a fault-tolerant system.

	2. Open a new command prompt in the location C:\kafka_2.12-2.8.0\bin\windows.

	3. Type the following command and hit Enter:
		kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic topic-vehicle-data
		

Creating a Producer and Consumer to Test Server
	1. Open a new command prompt in the location C:\kafka_2.12-2.8.0\bin\windows

	2. To start a producer type the following command:
		kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic topic-vehicle-data
	3. Again open a new command prompt in the same location as C:\kafka_2.12-2.8.0\bin\windows

	4. Now start a consumer by typing the following command:
		kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic topic-vehicle-data	

check for topics 

	kafka-topics.bat --list --zookeeper localhost:2181
